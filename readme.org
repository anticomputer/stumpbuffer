* StumpBuffer

  An IBuffer inspired tool to control Stumpwm from Emacs. Still
  experimental and unstable. Currently Does not work with floating
  groups.

* Installing

  Ensure that you have stumpish available. Load ~emacs/stumpbuffer/~
  in Emacs and ~cl/stumpbuffer/~ in Stumpwm.

* Use

  Use ~M-x stumpbuffer~ to open the buffer. This should show all
  groups and windows.
