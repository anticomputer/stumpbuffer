* StumpBuffer

  An IBuffer inspired tool to control Stumpwm from Emacs. Still
  experimental and unstable. Currently does not work with floating
  groups.

  This uses a lot of Stumpwms internals, and so may or may not work on
  any given version of Stumpwm.

* Installing

  Ensure that you have stumpish available. Load ~emacs/stumpbuffer/~
  in Emacs and ~cl/stumpbuffer/~ in Stumpwm.

* Use

  Use ~M-x stumpbuffer~ to open the buffer. This should show all
  groups and windows. ~M-x stumpbuffer-other-frame~ can be used to
  open the buffer in another frame, which will be killed when exiting
  the stumpbuffer.

  The customization option ~stumpbuffer-quit-window-after-command~
  determines whether the buffer should be killed when executing
  certain commands (such as focusing a window).
